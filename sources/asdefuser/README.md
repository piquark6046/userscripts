# asdefuser â€” AdShield Defuser

The development of asdefuser is not public.
You can request the access to the private library named `adshield-defuser` by contacting [seia@outlook.kr](mailto:seia@outlook.kr).

## Targets

We target all modern distribution of web browsers with any kind of userscript support.
Especially, we treat only *violentmonkey* as full featured userscript manager.

- Chrome, Firefox, and all browsers with their backend are supported.
- Safari via UserScripts app but not all browsers provides loose environment for userscripts are supported.

In loose environment, we cannot ensure the full control of the main world that website runs.
Therefore, the functionalities require to be done at `document-start`, before `document.readyState` changes, may not work.

However, we can mitigate AdShield scripts even if those limitations exist in loose environment.
