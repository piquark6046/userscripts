# ubyoutube â€” Universal YouTube

This userscript helps you to mitigate mobile YouTube ads by mixing two methods on Safari:
- Automatic advertisement skip
- Advertisement data prune

## Targets

We target latest Apple devices running Safari with userscript app and ad blockers applying EasyList.
The inconsistency of userscript on Safari is already known and we're planning to fix slowly without making any performance issues.

## Restriction in Loose environments

See detailed information in [asdefuser/README.md](../asdefuser/README.md).
